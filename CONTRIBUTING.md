# Contributing to YoPix

> ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Quick heads up: YoPix was built by a dad with zero development experience, paired with AI (Claude) to create a tool I wished existed for my Yoto Player adventures. The code might be messy, probably breaks a bunch of best practices, and could make seasoned developers cry - but hey, it works! ðŸ˜…

> This project stands on the shoulders of giants, using amazing open-source tools like Pixel It, Next.js, and others. Please support these original projects and their creators. YoPix is not meant for profit - it's just a fun tool for the community.
>
> Also important to note: This project has no affiliation with Yoto or Yoto Player. I'm just a dad who wanted an easier way to make pixel art for my kids' cards.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to YoPix! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to have you help make YoPix even better. This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.
