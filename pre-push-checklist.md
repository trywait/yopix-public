# GitHub Pre-Push Security Checklist

## Before Making Your Repository Public

- [ ] Ensure `.env.local` and any other files with real credentials are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Check that no real API keys or tokens are hardcoded in your source code
- [ ] Verify that your `.env.local.example` file uses placeholders instead of real values
- [ ] Scan your commit history for any accidentally committed sensitive data
- [ ] Remove any test accounts or default passwords
- [ ] Make sure no internal URLs, IPs, or hostnames are exposed
- [ ] Check for any commented-out code containing sensitive information
- [ ] Verify that the AI model files in `public/models` are properly downloaded and not committed
- [ ] Check that no test images or user uploads are committed to the repository

## Repository Configuration

- [ ] Add a clear README with setup instructions
- [ ] Consider adding a SECURITY.md file with security policy
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules for main/master branch
- [ ] Configure dependency scanning tools (Dependabot, etc.)
- [ ] Add proper error handling for API rate limits and failures
- [ ] Ensure all external API endpoints are properly documented

## After Publishing

- [ ] Validate that sensitive files are not accessible in the public repository
- [ ] Consider setting up secret scanning alerts in GitHub
- [ ] Monitor for exposure of new secrets or sensitive data
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test the application with the production environment variables
- [ ] Verify that the background removal feature works with the downloaded models

Remember: The best practice is to use environment variables for all sensitive configuration and never commit real credentials to your repository. For YoPix specifically, make sure to:
- Keep API keys for Google AI and Unsplash secure
- Handle user uploads securely and implement proper file size limits
- Test the application thoroughly with different image types and sizes
- Ensure the pixel art conversion works correctly with the 16Ã—16 constraint
